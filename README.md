**Project Description and Goal**
  
Responsive web implementation using fluid layouts, CSS Grid, Flexbox, media queries, and flexible units (%, rem/em, vw/vh) to ensure perfect display, readability, and usability across all major screen sizes and devices.

The goal of this project is to deliver a fully responsive web implementation that ensures every UI component, layout, and interactive element displays correctly, remains readable, and functions intuitively across the most common screen resolutions and devices in use today.

**Description of the technologies**

This project leverages CSS Grid for robust two-dimensional page layouts and Flexbox for precise component alignment, combined with a device responsive approach using grids, relative units (% and rem/em for typography), and media queries to ensure seamless adaptation across devices.
